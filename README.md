chordguesser
============

A little utility that will (eventually) listen to MIDI sources and guess which chords are being played.

update:  The chordguesser thingy never did exactly what I wanted it to.  Some bugs I never had time
to remove.  However, there is now something else I want to try:

  * On the mac, set up a virtual midi device.
  * Send a sequence of midi output to that devie.
  * Route the midi signals to a virtual instrument.
  * Hear the pings.

Why?  Because I want to make algorithmic music.  In particular I want events that can be picked
up by monitoring (networks, the environment or whatever) to be transformed into MIDI signals
and then expressed as surfaces of sound.  This is something so cool that it just has to be done,
and these virtual MIDI thingys may be the entry point I need to get started. Anyway, I want to try!
